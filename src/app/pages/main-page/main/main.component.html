    <div class="description">
      Welcome to Trello! Simple, flexible, and powerful. All it takes are
      boards, lists, and cards to get a clear view of who’s doing what and what
      needs to get done. Trello brings all your tasks, teammates, and tools
      together

          <h3>Boards</h3>
          <p>
            Trello boards keep tasks organized and work moving forward. In a
            glance, see everything from “things to do” to “aww yeah, we did it!

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Lists</h3>
          <p>
            The different stages of a task. Start as simple as To Do, Doing or
            Done—or build a workflow custom fit to your team’s needs. There’s no
            wrong way to Trello.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cards</h3>
          <p>
            Cards represent tasks and ideas and hold all the information to get
            the job done. As you make progress, move cards across lists to show
            their status.
